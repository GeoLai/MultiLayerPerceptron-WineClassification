# MultiLayerPerceptron-WineClassification

This is a my first Artificial Neural Network using Multi Layer Perceptron. The network was built on classification of wine, 
with 178 rows of data with 13 feature vectors that defines the quality of the wine. The entire coding exercise built on Python
Programming language with markdown language for the code documentation.

Output of the network gave 3 classes classification with accuracy of 1.0 without any error during testing of the model. This was 
achieved by training with several node configuration in each hidden layer. No overfitting of the model was detected based on the 
evaluation metrics.

Data was courtesy of UCI Dataset for this network.
